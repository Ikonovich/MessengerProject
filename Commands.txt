Commands:

When a message beginning with the letters "CO" is sent, the server inteprets this as a command. The Message
component of a command (The remainder of the message after the bitmask parsing has been completed) must be a 
JSON-formatted a dictionary containing, at minimum, a "Command" key with an associated string value.
Depending on which command is used, the dictionary must also contain other keys, most commonly "UserID", containing
the User ID of the user to be acted upon by the command.

Commands can not be carried out on users with higher permissions than the commanding user.

The available commands and their additional key-value requirements are as follows:

"RestrictUploading": UserID  // Removes the Upload permission.
"AllowUploading" : UserID  // Adds the Upload permission.
"Mute": UserID // Removes the Talk permission
"Unmute" : UserID // Restores the Talk permission
"Ban" : UserID // Removes the read and talk permissions
"Unban" : UserID // Restores the read and talk permissions

// Only owners can utilize these commands.

"AllowDelete" : UserID // Allows the user to delete messages
"DisallowDelete" : UserID // Disllows the user from deleting messages
"AllowRestrict" : UserID // Allows the user to restrict/allow uploads
"DisallowRestrict" : UserID // Disallows the user from restricting/allowing uploads
"AllowMute" : UserID // Allows the user to mute/unmute other users
"DisallowMute" : UserID // Disallows the user from muting/unmuting other users
"AllowBan" : UserID // Allows the user to ban/unban other users
"DisallowBan" : UserID // Disallows the user from banning/unbanning other users
