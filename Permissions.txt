Permissions are defined using a bitmask, arranged in the following order, from LSB to MSB (little endian):

0: Can Read
1: Can Talk
2: Can Upload Files
3: Can Delete
4: Can Restrict uploading
5: Can Mute 
6: Can Ban
7: Chat Owner



Muted users cannot talk. Banned users cannot read or talk. Only chat owners can change other user's permissions.


These permissions are enumerated in both server and client under Permissions (In the server as a class,
in the client as an enum). There exist the following:

Permissions.Read
Permissions.Talk
Permissions.Upload
Permissions.Delete
Permissions.Restrict
Permissions.Mute
Permissions.Ban

These permissions are stored in individual user-chat pairs in the field Permissions.
